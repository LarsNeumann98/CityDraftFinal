                    The algorithm has the two main components of a cube assembled from smaller cubes and an attraction point
		    influencing the cubes geometry.
		    The amount of cubes that the larger cube is assembled from, as well as their size, can be controlled by a slider.
		    The attraction point has a maximum distance from which it influences the cubes. Inside of that distance,
		    the cubes are pulled towards the attraction point, as well as scaled down. The closer the cubes are to the attraction point,
		    the farther towards the attraction point they are translated relative to their previous position and the smaller they get.
		    The Position of the attraction point is also controlleable by an integrated GUI and changes the Translation and scale
		of the cubes trough an update loop.
