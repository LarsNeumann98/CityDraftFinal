                <p>
                    The recursive algorithm shown here is based on that of a Koch-snowflake. The base-principle beeing that it starts with an<br />
		    equilateral triangle and places another equilateral triangle in the middle third of every line with every iteration.<br />
		    While doing so, the initial middle third of the original line is deleted and the outwards edge of the newly placed triangle<br />
		    becomes part of the new circumference of the object. This leads to the interesting observation that the surface area<br />
		    of the Koch snowflake is finite, while the circumference is infinite.<br />
		    I experimented with the parameters for the snowflake and decided to not only let the algorithm place the new triangles on<br />
		    the outside of the existing ones, but to have predefined vectors in the code that place the triangles on both sides of the base<br />
		    geometry. With increasing iterations, this creates quite interesting patterns, and opens up the possibility to change the vectors<br />
		    defined in the code to create an infinite amount of Koch-Snowflake inspired patterns.

                    Algorithm
                </header>
                <p>
                    The code for the variable Koch-Snowflake starts with the definition of different lists beeing used to store the point vectors during the iterative process<br />
		    and a dictionary containing variables that can be altered to easily influence the structure. Also the start geometry, an eqilateral triangle, is created here.<br />
		    From here the main three functions responsible for generating and displaying the geometry are called. The system-function mainly contains an if statement, <br />
		    which calls the generate-function as long as the predefined maximum amount of iterations is not yet reached. Inside the generate-function the main part of the<br />
		    geometry generation is happening. The function starts with a list of every point making up the existing lines. Now two neighbouring point-vectors <br />
		    representing a line between them are paired together by an for-loop. For every single one of these point-pairs their connecting vector is now split into three parts<br />
		    the middle part is taken out and insted a equilateral triangle with sides one third as long as the original connecting vector is placed here.<br />
		    When the maximum amount of iterations is reached, a list containing all the geometries points in te right order is sent to the draw-function which then generates<br />
		    a closed line through the generated points.

                    Klick and drag on the geometry to turn or move it, scroll to zoom in. This is 7 iterations of the afformentioned process.<br />
		    A GUI to change the iterations and shape is currently in developement.
